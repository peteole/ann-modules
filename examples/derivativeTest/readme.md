# Test of the derivative computation method
I'm gonna use the same network as in the first steps example. After initialization, the plan is to compute the error for any training example, pick any parameter, alter it a tiny bit and compute how much the error changes after the change per change of the parameter. This value should be identical with the derivative conputed by the addDerivative-method.
